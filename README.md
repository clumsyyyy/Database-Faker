# Database-Faker

During my Database course we are tasked to create a mock relational database model based on the FIFA World Cup rules, so I created a MySQL database faker using Python's Faker library
and mysql.connector. It's not anything fancy, this repo is made in case anyone (or at least me myself) needs a reference to create a mock database using Python.
